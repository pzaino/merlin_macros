# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a **welcoming, inclusive, and respectful environment** for everyone â€” regardless of experience level, background, or personal identity.

This project adopts the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct), with minor adaptations for the Merlin project.

## ðŸ§­ Our Guiding Principles

- Be kind and respectful in all interactions.
- Assume good intent, but understand that impact matters more than intent.
- Disagreements should be handled with patience and empathy.
- We welcome discussion, curiosity, and constructive criticism â€” not harassment or personal attacks.

## ðŸš« Unacceptable Behavior Includes

- Insulting or derogatory comments
- Personal or political attacks
- Trolling, baiting, or disruptive behavior
- Sexual or violent language or imagery
- Public or private harassment
- Dismissing others' contributions based on perceived "status"

## ðŸš¨ Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please contact **Paolo Fabio Zaino** (project lead) via GitHub or the project's contact channels. Reports will be treated with confidentiality and seriousness.

ðŸ’¬ *Letâ€™s make Merlin a space where ideas thrive, learning is encouraged, and everyone feels safe to contribute.*

Thank you.
